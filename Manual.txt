I CAN'T SEE WHEN THE POWERUPS ARE ACTIVE!!!!  Read Section 7

A SHIT TON OF ENEMIES CAME OUT OF NOWHERE IN THE START!!    Read Section 1

YOU TRIED USING CustomEnemyPositions AND SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED!!   Read Section 5

YOU DON'T GET HOW BIOMES WORK!!!    Read Section 2

YOU DON'T GET WHAT A BiomeSectorManager IS!!!  Read Section 2.1

YOU DON'T GET WHAT THAT TickPeriod VARIABLE IS!!!    Read Section 2.2

YOU HAD A SHIT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!!    Read Section 3

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT MODE IN CustomFormations!!!   Read Section 4

THE CHECKPOINT SYSTEM IS NOT SAVING!!!!   Read Section 6


/////////////////////////////Section 1////////////////////////////

If you are making a new biomes all the components attached to that
GameObject MUST BE DISABLED. (Just like those of Savanna)

/////////////////////////////Section 2////////////////////////////

Each Biome is represented by one GameObject that contains pairs of
scripts representing the sectors of that biome.
Adding a new Biome with its own pallete of enemies and formations
is now as simple as making that new GameObject, creating the
formations of each section and done!

/////////////////////////////Section 2.1//////////////////////////

Each BiomeSectorManager is connected to its own CustomFormations
script which holds the formations that will spawn in that sector
of that biome. Each Sector can be of four types:

Transitional; This Sector will begin the next sector it is assigned
after its length has been traversed by the player.

Last; Upon the end of this Sector it will notify the EnemySpawner
that this biome has finished.

Transitional/Last_Boss; These biomes behave the same way only they
will spawn their boss mob before ending.

/////////////////////////////Section 2.2//////////////////////////

The tickPeriod is a variable in CustomFormations which is the time
elapsed between everytime it checks to spawn a formation. In other
words the tickPeriod is the minimum amount of time between two
consecutive formations.(And has a massive impact on difficulty)

/////////////////////////////Section 3/////////////////////////////////

Our game currently has a very noob profiling issue... Each frame it
waits TWENTY EIGHT milliseconds for a thread to finish.
Its in PostLateUpdate.FinishFrameRendering. I know it has something
to do with rendering :p but idk wth it is. But hey if you can fix
that the remaining code is taking like 5-8 ms not even kidding.

/////////////////////////////Section 4/////////////////////////////////

CustomFormations script serves two purposes, for random generation in
Biomes and for Sequencial waves when attached to a boss.
Random mode is pretty self explanatory.
When attached to a boss set the mode to sequencial. When you are
editing a formation you can add it to the sequence before saving. This
will store the relative position of that formation to player and its
index. Then the boss spawns each wave in the sequence one by one.

/////////////////////////////Section 5/////////////////////////////////

CustomEnemyPositions is now deprecated, DO NOT USE IT ANYWHERE.
CustomFormations can pretty much do what it did and I didn't wanna
delete it cuz it took alot of hardwork ;(

//////////////////////////////Section 6////////////////////////////////

It is saving... Currently our game has difficulty progression in a
Biome cuz you can have different enemies in different Sectors and so on.
But outside of Biomes there is no progression, the enemySpawner just
picks a random Biome and initializes its first sector.
In conclusion no matter how far you are in the game it will look the same.

//////////////////////////////Section 7////////////////////////////////

oh i didnt add that yet. currently the player has no way of knowing which
powerup is active.
